We first get the length len of the list. Then we know we need to perform len / k groups of reverse operations. In each group, the reverse is performed for k - 1 times.

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseKGroup(ListNode* head, int k) {
        dummy -> next = head;
        int len = length(head);
        for (int i = 0; i < len / k; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < k; j++) {
                ListNode* temp = pre -> next;
                pre -> next = head -> next;
                head -> next = head -> next -> next;
                pre -> next -> next = temp;
            }
            pre = head;
            head = head -> next;
        }
        return dummy -> next;
    }
private:
    ListNode *dummy = new ListNode(0), *pre = dummy;
    int length(ListNode* head) {
        int len = 0;
        while (head) {
            len++;
            head = head -> next;
        }
        return len;
    }
};
