use a hash map to store boundary information of consecutive sequence for each element; there are 4 cases when a new element i reached:

neither i+1 nor i-1 has been seen: m[i]=1;

both i+1 and i-1 have been seen: extend m[i+m[i+1]] and m[i-m[i-1]] to each other;

only i+1 has been seen: extend m[i+m[i+1]] and m[i] to each other;

only i-1 has been seen: extend m[i-m[i-1]] and m[i] to each other.

int longestConsecutive(vector<int> &num) {
    unordered_map<int, int> m;
    int r = 0;
    for (int i : num) {
        if (m[i]) continue;
        r = max(r, m[i] = m[i + m[i + 1]] = m[i - m[i - 1]] = m[i + 1] + m[i - 1] + 1);
    }
    return r;
}
